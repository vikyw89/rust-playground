For example, every call to\n/// [`write`][`TcpStream::write`] on [`TcpStream`] results in a system call. A\n/// `BufWriter<W>` keeps an in-memory buffer of data and writes it to an underlying\n/// writer in large, infrequent batches.\n///\n/// `BufWriter<W>` can improve the speed of programs that make *small* and\n/// *repeated* write calls to the same file or network socket. It does not\n/// help when writing very large amounts at once, or writing just one or a few\n/// times. It also provides no advantage when writing to a destination that is\n/// in memory, like a <code>[Vec]\\<u8></code>.\n///\n/// It is critical to call [`flush`] before `BufWriter<W>` is dropped. Though\n/// dropping will attempt to flush the contents of the buffer, any errors\n/// that happen in the process of dropping will be ignored. Calling [`flush`]\n/// ensures that the buffer is empty and thus dropping will not even attempt\n/// file operations.\n///\n/// # Examples\n///\n/// Let's write the numbers one through ten to a [`TcpStream`]:\n///\n/// ```no_run\n/// use std::io::prelude::*;\n/// use std::net::TcpStream;\n///\n/// let mut stream = TcpStream::connect(\"127.0.0.1:34254\").unwrap();\n///\n/// for i in 0..10 {\n///     stream.write(&[i+1]).unwrap();\n/// }\n/// ```\n///\n/// Because we're not buffering, we write each one in turn, incurring the\n/// overhead of a system call per byte written. We can fix this with a\n/// `BufWriter<W>`:\n///\n/// ```no_run\n/// use std::io::prelude::*;\n/// use std::io::BufWriter;\n/// use std::net::TcpStream;\n///\n/// let mut stream = BufWriter::new(TcpStream::connect(\"127.0.0.1:34254\").unwrap());\n///\n/// for i in 0..10 {\n///     stream.write(&[i+1]).unwrap();\n/// }\n/// stream.flush().unwrap();\n/// ```\n///\n/// By wrapping the stream with a `BufWriter<W>`, these ten writes are all grouped\n/// together by the buffer and will all be written out in one system call when\n/// the `stream` is flushed.\n///\n/// [`TcpStream::write`]: crate::net::TcpStream::write\n/// [`TcpStream`]: crate::net::TcpStream\n/// [`flush`]: BufWriter::flush\n#[stable(feature = \"rust1\", since = \"1.0.0\")]\npub struct BufWriter<W: ?Sized + Write> {\n    // The buffer.

a writer and buffers its output.\n///\n/// It can be excessively inefficient to work directly with something that\n/// implements [`Write`]. For example, every call to\n/// [`write`][`TcpStream::write`] on [`TcpStream`] results in a system call. A\n/// `BufWriter&lt;W&gt;` keeps an in-memory buffer of data and writes it to an underlying\n/// writer in large, infrequent batches.\n///\n/// `BufWriter&lt;W&gt;` can improve the speed of programs that make *small* and\n/// *repeated* write calls to the same file or network socket. It does not\n/// help when writing very large amounts at once, or writing just one or a few\n/// times. It also provides no advantage when writing to a destination that is\n/// in memory, like a &lt;code&gt;[Vec]\\&lt;u8&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.\n///\n/// It is critical to call [`flush`] before `BufWriter&lt;W&gt;` is dropped. Though\n/// dropping will attempt to flush the contents of the buffer, any errors\n/// that happen in the process of dropping will be ignored. Calling [`flush`]\n/// ensures that the buffer is empty and thus dropping will not even attempt\n/// file operations.\n///\n/// # Examples\n///\n/// Let's write the numbers one through ten to a [`TcpStream`]:\n///\n/// ```no_run\n/// use std::io::prelude::*;\n/// use std::net::TcpStream;\n///\n/// let mut stream = TcpStream::connect(\"127.0.0.1:34254\").unwrap();\n///\n/// for i in 0..10 {\n///     stream.write(&amp;[i+1]).unwrap();\n/// }\n/// ```\n///\n/// Because we're not buffering, we write each one in turn, incurring the\n/// overhead of a system call per byte written. We can fix this with a\n/// `BufWriter&lt;W&gt;`:\n///\n/// ```no_run\n/// use std::io::prelude::*;\n/// use std::io::BufWriter;\n/// use std::net::TcpStream;\n///\n/// let mut stream = BufWriter::new(TcpStream::connect(\"127.0.0.1:34254\").unwrap());\n///\n/// for i in 0..10 {\n///     stream.write(&amp;[i+1]).unwrap();\n/// }\n/// stream.flush().unwrap();\n/// ```\n///\n/// By wrapping the stream with a `BufWriter&lt;W&gt;`, these ten writes are all grouped\n/// together by the buffer and will all be written out in one system call when\n/// the `stream` is flushed.\n///\n/// [`TcpStream::write`]: crate::net::TcpStream::write\n/// [`TcpStream`]: crate::net::TcpStream\n/// [`flush`]: BufWriter::flush\n</span><span class=\"attr\">#[stable(feature = <span class=\"string\">\"rust1\"</span>, since = <span class=\"string\">\"1.0.0\"</span>)]\n</span><span class=\"kw\">pub struct </span>BufWriter&lt;W: <span class=\"question-mark\">?</span>Sized + Write&gt; {\n    <span class=\"comment\">// The buffer.
