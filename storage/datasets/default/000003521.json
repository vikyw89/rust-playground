If you've found yourself with a collection of some kind, and needed to\n//! perform an operation on the elements of said collection, you'll quickly run\n//! into 'iterators'. Iterators are heavily used in idiomatic Rust code, so\n//! it's worth becoming familiar with them.\n//!\n//! Before explaining more, let's talk about how this module is structured:\n//!\n//! # Organization\n//!\n//! This module is largely organized by type:\n//!\n//! * [Traits] are the core portion: these traits define what kind of iterators\n//!   exist and what you can do with them. The methods of these traits are worth\n//!   putting some extra study time into.\n//! * [Functions] provide some helpful ways to create some basic iterators.\n//! * [Structs] are often the return types of the various methods on this\n//!   module's traits. You'll usually want to look at the method that creates\n//!   the `struct`, rather than the `struct` itself. For more detail about why,\n//!   see '[Implementing Iterator](#implementing-iterator)'.\n//!\n//! [Traits]: #traits\n//! [Functions]: #functions\n//! [Structs]: #structs\n//!\n//! That's it! Let's dig into iterators.\n//!\n//! # Iterator\n//!\n//! The heart and soul of this module is the [`Iterator`] trait. The core of\n//! [`Iterator`] looks like this:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! trait Iterator {\n//!     type Item;\n//!     fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item>;\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! An iterator has a method, [`next`], which when called, returns an\n//! <code>[Option]\\<Item></code>. Calling [`next`] will return [`Some(Item)`] as long as there\n//! are elements, and once they've all been exhausted, will return `None` to\n//! indicate that iteration is finished. Individual iterators may choose to\n//! resume iteration, and so calling [`next`] again may or may not eventually\n//! start returning [`Some(Item)`] again at some point (for example, see [`TryIter`]).\n//!\n//! [`Iterator`]'s full definition includes a number of other methods as well,\n//! but they are default methods, built on top of [`next`], and so you get\n//! them for free.\n//!\n//! Iterators are also composable, and it's common to chain them together to do\n//! more complex forms of processing. See the [Adapters](#adapters) section\n//! below for more details.\n//!\n//! [`Some(Item)`]: Some\n//! [`next`]: Iterator::next\n//! [`TryIter`]: ../../std/sync/mpsc/struct.TryIter.html\n//!\n//! # The three forms of iteration\n//!\n//! There are three common methods which can create iterators from a collection:\n//!\n//! * `iter()`, which iterates over `&T`.\n//! * `iter_mut()`, which iterates over `&mut T`.\n//! * `into_iter()`, which iterates over `T`.\n//!\n//! Various things in the standard library may implement one or more of the\n//! three, where appropriate.\n//!\n//! # Implementing Iterator\n//!\n//! Creating an iterator of your own involves two steps: creating a `struct` to\n//! hold the iterator's state, and then implementing [`Iterator`] for that `struct`.\n//! This is why there are so many `struct`s in this module: there is one for\n//! each iterator and iterator adapter.\n//!\n//! Let's make an iterator named `Counter` which counts from `1` to `5`:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! // First, the struct:\n//!\n//! /// An iterator which counts from one to five\n//! struct Counter {\n//!     count: usize,\n//! }\n//!\n//! // we want our count to start at one, so let's add a new() method to help.\n//! // This isn't strictly necessary, but is convenient. Note that we start\n//! // `count` at zero, we'll see why in `next()`'s implementation below.\n//! impl Counter {\n//!     fn new() -> Counter {\n//!         Counter { count: 0 }\n//!     }\n//! }\n//!\n//! // Then, we implement `Iterator` for our `Counter`:\n//!\n//! impl Iterator for Counter {\n//!     // we will be counting with usize\n//!     type Item = usize;\n//!\n//!     // next() is the only required method\n//!     fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {\n//!         // Increment our count. This is why we started at zero.\n//!         self.count += 1;\n//!\n//!         // Check to see if we've finished counting or not.\n//!         if self.count < 6 {\n//!             Some(self.count)\n//!         } else {\n//!             None\n//!         }\n//!     }\n//! }\n//!\n//! // And now we can use it!\n//!\n//! let mut counter = Counter::new();\n//!\n//! assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(1));\n//! assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(2));\n//! assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(3));\n//! assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(4));\n//! assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(5));\n//! assert_eq!(counter.next(), None);\n//! ```\n//!\n//! Calling [`next`] this way gets repetitive. Rust has a construct which can\n//! call [`next`] on your iterator, until it reaches `None`. Let's go over that\n//! next.\n//!\n//! Also note that `Iterator` provides a default implementation of methods such as `nth` and `fold`\n//! which call `next` internally. However, it is also possible to write a custom implementation of\n//! methods like `nth` and `fold` if an iterator can compute them more efficiently without calling\n//! `next`.\n//!\n//! # `for` loops and `IntoIterator`\n//!\n//! Rust's `for` loop syntax is actually sugar for iterators. Here's a basic\n//! example of `for`:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let values = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n//!\n//! for x in values {\n//!     println!(\"{x}\");\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! This will print the numbers one through five, each on their own line. But\n//! you'll notice something here: we never called anything on our vector to\n//! produce an iterator. What gives?\n//!\n//! There's a trait in the standard library for converting something into an\n//! iterator: [`IntoIterator`]. This trait has one method, [`into_iter`],\n//! which converts the thing implementing [`IntoIterator`] into an iterator.\n//! Let's take a look at that `for` loop again, and what the compiler converts\n//! it into:\n//!\n//! [`into_iter`]: IntoIterator::into_iter\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let values = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n//!\n//! for x in values {\n//!     println!(\"{x}\");\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! Rust de-sugars this into:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let values = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n//! {\n//!     let result = match IntoIterator::into_iter(values) {\n//!         mut iter => loop {\n//!             let next;\n//!             match iter.next() {\n//!                 Some(val) => next = val,\n//!                 None => break,\n//!             };\n//!             let x = next;\n//!             let () = { println!(\"{x}\"); };\n//!         },\n//!     };\n//!     result\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! First, we call `into_iter()` on the value. Then, we match on the iterator\n//! that returns, calling [`next`] over and over until we see a `None`. At\n//! that point, we `break` out of the loop, and we're done iterating.\n//!\n//! There's one more subtle bit here: the standard library contains an\n//! interesting implementation of [`IntoIterator`]:\n//!\n//! ```ignore (only-for-syntax-highlight)\n//! impl<I: Iterator> IntoIterator for I\n//! ```\n//!\n//! In other words, all [`Iterator`]s implement [`IntoIterator`], by just\n//! returning themselves. This means two things:\n//!\n//! 1. If you're writing an [`Iterator`], you can use it with a `for` loop.\n//! 2. If you're creating a collection, implementing [`IntoIterator`] for it\n//!    will allow your collection to be used with the `for` loop.\n//!\n//! # Iterating by reference\n//!\n//! Since [`into_iter()`] takes `self` by value, using a `for` loop to iterate\n//! over a collection consumes that collection. Often, you may want to iterate\n//! over a collection without consuming it. Many collections offer methods that\n//! provide iterators over references, conventionally called `iter()` and\n//! `iter_mut()` respectively:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let mut values = vec![41];\n//! for x in values.iter_mut() {\n//!     *x += 1;\n//! }\n//! for x in values.iter() {\n//!     assert_eq!(*x, 42);\n//! }\n//! assert_eq!(values.len(), 1); // `values` is still owned by this function.\n//! ```\n//!\n//! If a collection type `C` provides `iter()`, it usually also implements\n//! `IntoIterator` for `&C`, with an implementation that just calls `iter()`.\n//! Likewise, a collection `C` that provides `iter_mut()` generally implements\n//! `IntoIterator` for `&mut C` by delegating to `iter_mut()`. This enables a\n//! convenient shorthand:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let mut values = vec![41];\n//! for x in &mut values { // same as `values.iter_mut()`\n//!     *x += 1;\n//! }\n//! for x in &values { // same as `values.iter()`\n//!     assert_eq!(*x, 42);\n//! }\n//! assert_eq!(values.len(), 1);\n//! ```\n//!\n//! While many collections offer `iter()`, not all offer `iter_mut()`. For\n//! example, mutating the keys of a [`HashSet<T>`] could put the collection\n//! into an inconsistent state if the key hashes change, so this collection\n//! only offers `iter()`.\n//!\n//! [`into_iter()`]: IntoIterator::into_iter\n//! [`HashSet<T>`]: ../../std/collections/struct.HashSet.html\n//!\n//! # Adapters\n//!\n//! Functions which take an [`Iterator`] and return another [`Iterator`] are\n//! often called 'iterator adapters', as they're a form of the 'adapter\n//! pattern'.\n//!\n//! Common iterator adapters include [`map`], [`take`], and [`filter`].\n//! For more, see their documentation.\n//!\n//! If an iterator adapter panics, the iterator will be in an unspecified (but\n//! memory safe) state.  This state is also not guaranteed to stay the same\n//! across versions of Rust, so you should avoid relying on the exact values\n//! returned by an iterator which panicked.\n//!\n//! [`map`]: Iterator::map\n//! [`take`]: Iterator::take\n//! [`filter`]: Iterator::filter\n//!\n//! # Laziness\n//!\n//! Iterators (and iterator [adapters](#adapters)) are *lazy*. This means that\n//! just creating an iterator doesn't _do_ a whole lot. Nothing really happens\n//! until you call [`next`]. This is sometimes a source of confusion when\n//! creating an iterator solely for its side effects. For example, the [`map`]\n//! method calls a closure on each element it iterates over:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! # #![allow(unused_must_use)]\n//! # #![allow(map_unit_fn)]\n//! let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n//! v.iter().map(|x| println!(\"{x}\"));\n//! ```\n//!\n//! This will not print any values, as we only created an iterator, rather than\n//! using it. The compiler will warn us about this kind of behavior:\n//!\n//! ```text\n//! warning: unused result that must be used: iterators are lazy and\n//! do nothing unless consumed\n//! ```\n//!\n//! The idiomatic way to write a [`map`] for its side effects is to use a\n//! `for` loop or call the [`for_each`] method:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n//!\n//! v.iter().for_each(|x| println!(\"{x}\"));\n//! // or\n//! for x in &v {\n//!     println!(\"{x}\");\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! [`map`]: Iterator::map\n//! [`for_each`]: Iterator::for_each\n//!\n//! Another common way to evaluate an iterator is to use the [`collect`]\n//! method to produce a new collection.\n//!\n//! [`collect`]: Iterator::collect\n//!\n//! # Infinity\n//!\n//! Iterators do not have to be finite. As an example, an open-ended range is\n//! an infinite iterator:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let numbers = 0..;\n//! ```\n//!\n//! It is common to use the [`take`] iterator adapter to turn an infinite\n//! iterator into a finite one:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let numbers = 0..;\n//! let five_numbers = numbers.take(5);\n//!\n//! for number in five_numbers {\n//!     println!(\"{number}\");\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! This will print the numbers `0` through `4`, each on their own line.\n//!\n//! Bear in mind that methods on infinite iterators, even those for which a\n//! result can be determined mathematically in finite time, might not terminate.\n//! Specifically, methods such as [`min`], which in the general case require\n//! traversing every element in the iterator, are likely not to return\n//! successfully for any infinite iterators.\n//!\n//! ```no_run\n//! let ones = std::iter::repeat(1);\n//! let least = ones.min().unwrap(); // Oh no! An infinite loop!\n//! // `ones.min()` causes an infinite loop, so we won't reach this point!\n//! println!(\"The smallest number one is {least}.\");\n//! ```\n//!\n//! [`take`]: Iterator::take\n//! [`min`]: Iterator::min\n\n#![stable(feature = \"rust1\", since = \"1.0.0\")]\n\n// This needs to be up here in order to be usable in the child modules\nmacro_rules! impl_fold_via_try_fold {\n    (fold -> try_fold) => {\n        impl_fold_via_try_fold! { @internal fold -> try_fold }\n    };\n    (rfold -> try_rfold) => {\n        impl_fold_via_try_fold! { @internal rfold -> try_rfold }\n    };\n    (spec_fold -> spec_try_fold) => {\n        impl_fold_via_try_fold! { @internal spec_fold -> spec_try_fold }\n    };\n    (spec_rfold -> spec_try_rfold) => {\n        impl_fold_via_try_fold! { @internal spec_rfold -> spec_try_rfold }\n    };\n    (@internal $fold:ident -> $try_fold:ident) => {\n        #[inline]\n        fn $fold<AAA, FFF>(mut self, init: AAA, fold: FFF) -> AAA\n        where\n            FFF: FnMut(AAA, Self::Item) -> AAA,\n        {\n            use crate::ops::NeverShortCircuit;\n\n            self.$try_fold(init, NeverShortCircuit::wrap_mut_2(fold)).0\n        }\n    };\n}\n\n#[stable(feature = \"rust1\", since = \"1.0.0\")]\npub use self::traits::Iterator;\n\n#[unstable(\n    feature = \"step_trait\",\n    reason = \"likely to be replaced by finer-grained traits\",\n    issue = \"42168\"\n)]\npub use self::range::Step;\n\n#[unstable(\n    feature = \"iter_from_coroutine\",\n    issue = \"43122\",\n    reason = \"coroutines are unstable\"\n)]\npub use self::sources::from_coroutine;\n#[stable(feature = \"iter_empty\", since = \"1.2.0\")]\npub use self::sources::{empty, Empty};\n#[stable(feature = \"iter_from_fn\", since = \"1.34.0\")]\npub use self::sources::{from_fn, FromFn};\n#[stable(feature = \"iter_once\", since = \"1.2.0\")]\npub use self::sources::{once, Once};\n#[stable(feature = \"iter_once_with\", since = \"1.43.0\")]\npub use self::sources::{once_with, OnceWith};\n#[stable(feature = \"rust1\", since = \"1.0.0\")]\npub use self::sources::{repeat, Repeat};\n#[unstable(feature = \"iter_repeat_n\", issue = \"104434\")]\npub use self::sources::{repeat_n, RepeatN};\n#[stable(feature = \"iterator_repeat_with\", since = \"1.28.0\")]\npub use self::sources::{repeat_with, RepeatWith};\n#[stable(feature = \"iter_successors\", since = \"1.34.0\")]\npub use self::sources::{successors, Successors};\n\n#[stable(feature = \"fused\", since = \"1.26.0\")]\npub use self::traits::FusedIterator;\n#[unstable(issue = \"none\", feature = \"inplace_iteration\")]\npub use self::traits::InPlaceIterable;\n#[unstable(issue = \"none\", feature = \"trusted_fused\")]\npub use self::traits::TrustedFused;\n#[unstable(feature = \"trusted_len\", issue = \"37572\")]\npub use self::traits::TrustedLen;\n#[unstable(feature = \"trusted_step\", issue = \"85731\")]\npub use self::traits::TrustedStep;\n#[stable(feature = \"rust1\", since = \"1.0.0\")]\npub use self::traits::{\n    DoubleEndedIterator, ExactSizeIterator, Extend, FromIterator, IntoIterator, Product, Sum,\n};\n\n#[unstable(feature = \"iter_chain\", reason = \"recently added\", issue = \"125964\")]\npub use self::adapters::chain;\n#[stable(feature = \"iter_zip\", since = \"1.59.0\")]\npub use self::adapters::zip;\n#[unstable(feature = \"iter_array_chunks\", reason = \"recently added\", issue = \"100450\")]\npub use self::adapters::ArrayChunks;\n#[unstable(feature = \"std_internals\", issue = \"none\")]\npub use self::adapters::ByRefSized;\n#[stable(feature = \"iter_cloned\", since = \"1.1.0\")]\npub use self::adapters::Cloned;\n#[stable(feature = \"iter_copied\", since = \"1.36.0\")]\npub use self::adapters::Copied;\n#[stable(feature = \"iterator_flatten\", since = \"1.29.0\")]\npub use self::adapters::Flatten;\n#[stable(feature = \"iter_map_while\", since = \"1.57.0\")]\npub use self::adapters::MapWhile;\n#[unstable(feature = \"iter_map_windows\", reason = \"recently added\", issue = \"87155\")]\npub use self::adapters::MapWindows;\n#[unstable(feature = \"inplace_iteration\", issue = \"none\")]\npub use self::adapters::SourceIter;\n#[stable(feature = \"iterator_step_by\", since = \"1.28.0\")]\npub use self::adapters::StepBy;\n#[unstable(feature = \"trusted_random_access\", issue = \"none\")]\npub use self::adapters::TrustedRandomAccess;\n#[unstable(feature = \"trusted_random_access\", issue = \"none\")]\npub use self::adapters::TrustedRandomAccessNoCoerce;\n#[stable(feature = \"rust1\", since = \"1.0.0\")]\npub use self::adapters::{\n    Chain, Cycle, Enumerate, Filter, FilterMap, FlatMap, Fuse, Inspect, Map, Peekable, Rev, Scan,\n    Skip, SkipWhile, Take, TakeWhile, Zip,\n};\n#[unstable(feature = \"iter_intersperse\", reason = \"recently added\", issue = \"79524\")]\npub use self::adapters::{Intersperse, IntersperseWith};\n\npub(crate) use self::adapters::try_process;\npub(crate) use self::traits::UncheckedIterator;\n\nmod adapters;\nmod range;\nmod sources;\nmod traits;\n\n```",

class=\"rust\"><code><span class=\"doccomment\">//! Composable external iteration.\n//!\n//! If you've found yourself with a collection of some kind, and needed to\n//! perform an operation on the elements of said collection, you'll quickly run\n//! into 'iterators'. Iterators are heavily used in idiomatic Rust code, so\n//! it's worth becoming familiar with them.\n//!\n//! Before explaining more, let's talk about how this module is structured:\n//!\n//! # Organization\n//!\n//! This module is largely organized by type:\n//!\n//! * [Traits] are the core portion: these traits define what kind of iterators\n//!   exist and what you can do with them. The methods of these traits are worth\n//!   putting some extra study time into.\n//! * [Functions] provide some helpful ways to create some basic iterators.\n//! * [Structs] are often the return types of the various methods on this\n//!   module's traits. You'll usually want to look at the method that creates\n//!   the `struct`, rather than the `struct` itself. For more detail about why,\n//!   see '[Implementing Iterator](#implementing-iterator)'.\n//!\n//! [Traits]: #traits\n//! [Functions]: #functions\n//! [Structs]: #structs\n//!\n//! That's it! Let's dig into iterators.\n//!\n//! # Iterator\n//!\n//! The heart and soul of this module is the [`Iterator`] trait. The core of\n//! [`Iterator`] looks like this:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! trait Iterator {\n//!     type Item;\n//!     fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt;;\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! An iterator has a method, [`next`], which when called, returns an\n//! &lt;code&gt;[Option]\\&lt;Item&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Calling [`next`] will return [`Some(Item)`] as long as there\n//! are elements, and once they've all been exhausted, will return `None` to\n//! indicate that iteration is finished. Individual iterators may choose to\n//! resume iteration, and so calling [`next`] again may or may not eventually\n//! start returning [`Some(Item)`] again at some point (for example, see [`TryIter`]).\n//!\n//! [`Iterator`]'s full definition includes a number of other methods as well,\n//! but they are default methods, built on top of [`next`], and so you get\n//! them for free.\n//!\n//! Iterators are also composable, and it's common to chain them together to do\n//! more complex forms of processing. See the [Adapters](#adapters) section\n//! below for more details.\n//!\n//! [`Some(Item)`]: Some\n//! [`next`]: Iterator::next\n//! [`TryIter`]: ../../std/sync/mpsc/struct.TryIter.html\n//!\n//! # The three forms of iteration\n//!\n//! There are three common methods which can create iterators from a collection:\n//!\n//! * `iter()`, which iterates over `&amp;T`.\n//! * `iter_mut()`, which iterates over `&amp;mut T`.\n//! * `into_iter()`, which iterates over `T`.\n//!\n//! Various things in the standard library may implement one or more of the\n//! three, where appropriate.\n//!\n//! # Implementing Iterator\n//!\n//! Creating an iterator of your own involves two steps: creating a `struct` to\n//! hold the iterator's state, and then implementing [`Iterator`] for that `struct`.\n//! This is why there are so many `struct`s in this module: there is one for\n//! each iterator and iterator adapter.\n//!\n//! Let's make an iterator named `Counter` which counts from `1` to `5`:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! // First, the struct:\n//!\n//! /// An iterator which counts from one to five\n//! struct Counter {\n//!     count: usize,\n//! }\n//!\n//! // we want our count to start at one, so let's add a new() method to help.\n//! // This isn't strictly necessary, but is convenient. Note that we start\n//! // `count` at zero, we'll see why in `next()`'s implementation below.\n//! impl Counter {\n//!     fn new() -&gt; Counter {\n//!         Counter { count: 0 }\n//!     }\n//! }\n//!\n//! // Then, we implement `Iterator` for our `Counter`:\n//!\n//! impl Iterator for Counter {\n//!     // we will be counting with usize\n//!     type Item = usize;\n//!\n//!     // next() is the only required method\n//!     fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt; {\n//!         // Increment our count. This is why we started at zero.\n//!         self.count += 1;\n//!\n//!         // Check to see if we've finished counting or not.\n//!         if self.count &lt; 6 {\n//!             Some(self.count)\n//!         } else {\n//!             None\n//!         }\n//!     }\n//! }\n//!\n//! // And now we can use it!\n//!\n//! let mut counter = Counter::new();\n//!\n//! assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(1));\n//! assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(2));\n//! assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(3));\n//! assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(4));\n//! assert_eq!(counter.next(), Some(5));\n//! assert_eq!(counter.next(), None);\n//! ```\n//!\n//! Calling [`next`] this way gets repetitive. Rust has a construct which can\n//! call [`next`] on your iterator, until it reaches `None`. Let's go over that\n//! next.\n//!\n//! Also note that `Iterator` provides a default implementation of methods such as `nth` and `fold`\n//! which call `next` internally. However, it is also possible to write a custom implementation of\n//! methods like `nth` and `fold` if an iterator can compute them more efficiently without calling\n//! `next`.\n//!\n//! # `for` loops and `IntoIterator`\n//!\n//! Rust's `for` loop syntax is actually sugar for iterators. Here's a basic\n//! example of `for`:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let values = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n//!\n//! for x in values {\n//!     println!(\"{x}\");\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! This will print the numbers one through five, each on their own line. But\n//! you'll notice something here: we never called anything on our vector to\n//! produce an iterator. What gives?\n//!\n//! There's a trait in the standard library for converting something into an\n//! iterator: [`IntoIterator`]. This trait has one method, [`into_iter`],\n//! which converts the thing implementing [`IntoIterator`] into an iterator.\n//! Let's take a look at that `for` loop again, and what the compiler converts\n//! it into:\n//!\n//! [`into_iter`]: IntoIterator::into_iter\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let values = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n//!\n//! for x in values {\n//!     println!(\"{x}\");\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! Rust de-sugars this into:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let values = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n//! {\n//!     let result = match IntoIterator::into_iter(values) {\n//!         mut iter =&gt; loop {\n//!             let next;\n//!             match iter.next() {\n//!                 Some(val) =&gt; next = val,\n//!                 None =&gt; break,\n//!             };\n//!             let x = next;\n//!             let () = { println!(\"{x}\"); };\n//!         },\n//!     };\n//!     result\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! First, we call `into_iter()` on the value. Then, we match on the iterator\n//! that returns, calling [`next`] over and over until we see a `None`. At\n//! that point, we `break` out of the loop, and we're done iterating.\n//!\n//! There's one more subtle bit here: the standard library contains an\n//! interesting implementation of [`IntoIterator`]:\n//!\n//! ```ignore (only-for-syntax-highlight)\n//! impl&lt;I: Iterator&gt; IntoIterator for I\n//! ```\n//!\n//! In other words, all [`Iterator`]s implement [`IntoIterator`], by just\n//! returning themselves. This means two things:\n//!\n//! 1. If you're writing an [`Iterator`], you can use it with a `for` loop.\n//! 2. If you're creating a collection, implementing [`IntoIterator`] for it\n//!    will allow your collection to be used with the `for` loop.\n//!\n//! # Iterating by reference\n//!\n//! Since [`into_iter()`] takes `self` by value, using a `for` loop to iterate\n//! over a collection consumes that collection. Often, you may want to iterate\n//! over a collection without consuming it. Many collections offer methods that\n//! provide iterators over references, conventionally called `iter()` and\n//! `iter_mut()` respectively:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let mut values = vec![41];\n//! for x in values.iter_mut() {\n//!     *x += 1;\n//! }\n//! for x in values.iter() {\n//!     assert_eq!(*x, 42);\n//! }\n//! assert_eq!(values.len(), 1); // `values` is still owned by this function.\n//! ```\n//!\n//! If a collection type `C` provides `iter()`, it usually also implements\n//! `IntoIterator` for `&amp;C`, with an implementation that just calls `iter()`.\n//! Likewise, a collection `C` that provides `iter_mut()` generally implements\n//! `IntoIterator` for `&amp;mut C` by delegating to `iter_mut()`. This enables a\n//! convenient shorthand:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let mut values = vec![41];\n//! for x in &amp;mut values { // same as `values.iter_mut()`\n//!     *x += 1;\n//! }\n//! for x in &amp;values { // same as `values.iter()`\n//!     assert_eq!(*x, 42);\n//! }\n//! assert_eq!(values.len(), 1);\n//! ```\n//!\n//! While many collections offer `iter()`, not all offer `iter_mut()`. For\n//! example, mutating the keys of a [`HashSet&lt;T&gt;`] could put the collection\n//! into an inconsistent state if the key hashes change, so this collection\n//! only offers `iter()`.\n//!\n//! [`into_iter()`]: IntoIterator::into_iter\n//! [`HashSet&lt;T&gt;`]: ../../std/collections/struct.HashSet.html\n//!\n//! # Adapters\n//!\n//! Functions which take an [`Iterator`] and return another [`Iterator`] are\n//! often called 'iterator adapters', as they're a form of the 'adapter\n//! pattern'.\n//!\n//! Common iterator adapters include [`map`], [`take`], and [`filter`].\n//! For more, see their documentation.\n//!\n//! If an iterator adapter panics, the iterator will be in an unspecified (but\n//! memory safe) state.  This state is also not guaranteed to stay the same\n//! across versions of Rust, so you should avoid relying on the exact values\n//! returned by an iterator which panicked.\n//!\n//! [`map`]: Iterator::map\n//! [`take`]: Iterator::take\n//! [`filter`]: Iterator::filter\n//!\n//! # Laziness\n//!\n//! Iterators (and iterator [adapters](#adapters)) are *lazy*. This means that\n//! just creating an iterator doesn't _do_ a whole lot. Nothing really happens\n//! until you call [`next`]. This is sometimes a source of confusion when\n//! creating an iterator solely for its side effects. For example, the [`map`]\n//! method calls a closure on each element it iterates over:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! # #![allow(unused_must_use)]\n//! # #![allow(map_unit_fn)]\n//! let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n//! v.iter().map(|x| println!(\"{x}\"));\n//! ```\n//!\n//! This will not print any values, as we only created an iterator, rather than\n//! using it. The compiler will warn us about this kind of behavior:\n//!\n//! ```text\n//! warning: unused result that must be used: iterators are lazy and\n//! do nothing unless consumed\n//! ```\n//!\n//! The idiomatic way to write a [`map`] for its side effects is to use a\n//! `for` loop or call the [`for_each`] method:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n//!\n//! v.iter().for_each(|x| println!(\"{x}\"));\n//! // or\n//! for x in &amp;v {\n//!     println!(\"{x}\");\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! [`map`]: Iterator::map\n//! [`for_each`]: Iterator::for_each\n//!\n//! Another common way to evaluate an iterator is to use the [`collect`]\n//! method to produce a new collection.\n//!\n//! [`collect`]: Iterator::collect\n//!\n//! # Infinity\n//!\n//! Iterators do not have to be finite. As an example, an open-ended range is\n//! an infinite iterator:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let numbers = 0..;\n//! ```\n//!\n//! It is common to use the [`take`] iterator adapter to turn an infinite\n//! iterator into a finite one:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let numbers = 0..;\n//! let five_numbers = numbers.take(5);\n//!\n//! for number in five_numbers {\n//!     println!(\"{number}\");\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! This will print the numbers `0` through `4`, each on their own line.\n//!\n//! Bear in mind that methods on infinite iterators, even those for which a\n//! result can be determined mathematically in finite time, might not terminate.\n//! Specifically, methods such as [`min`], which in the general case require\n//! traversing every element in the iterator, are likely not to return\n//! successfully for any infinite iterators.\n//!\n//! ```no_run\n//! let ones = std::iter::repeat(1);\n//! let least = ones.min().unwrap(); // Oh no! An infinite loop!\n//! // `ones.min()` causes an infinite loop, so we won't reach this point!\n//! println!(\"The smallest number one is {least}.\");\n//! ```\n//!\n//! [`take`]: Iterator::take\n//! [`min`]: Iterator::min\n\n</span><span class=\"attr\">#![stable(feature = <span class=\"string\">\"rust1\"</span>, since = <span class=\"string\">\"1.0.0\"</span>)]\n\n</span><span
