Rust's standard collection library provides efficient implementations of the\n//! most common general purpose programming data structures. By using the\n//! standard implementations, it should be possible for two libraries to\n//! communicate without significant data conversion.\n//!\n//! To get this out of the way: you should probably just use [`Vec`] or [`HashMap`].\n//! These two collections cover most use cases for generic data storage and\n//! processing. They are exceptionally good at doing what they do. All the other\n//! collections in the standard library have specific use cases where they are\n//! the optimal choice, but these cases are borderline *niche* in comparison.\n//! Even when `Vec` and `HashMap` are technically suboptimal, they're probably a\n//! good enough choice to get started.\n//!\n//! Rust's collections can be grouped into four major categories:\n//!\n//! * Sequences: [`Vec`], [`VecDeque`], [`LinkedList`]\n//! * Maps: [`HashMap`], [`BTreeMap`]\n//! * Sets: [`HashSet`], [`BTreeSet`]\n//! * Misc: [`BinaryHeap`]\n//!\n//! # When Should You Use Which Collection?\n//!\n//! These are fairly high-level and quick break-downs of when each collection\n//! should be considered. Detailed discussions of strengths and weaknesses of\n//! individual collections can be found on their own documentation pages.\n//!\n//! ### Use a `Vec` when:\n//! * You want to collect items up to be processed or sent elsewhere later, and\n//!   don't care about any properties of the actual values being stored.\n//! * You want a sequence of elements in a particular order, and will only be\n//!   appending to (or near) the end.\n//! * You want a stack.\n//! * You want a resizable array.\n//! * You want a heap-allocated array.\n//!\n//! ### Use a `VecDeque` when:\n//! * You want a [`Vec`] that supports efficient insertion at both ends of the\n//!   sequence.\n//! * You want a queue.\n//! * You want a double-ended queue (deque).\n//!\n//! ### Use a `LinkedList` when:\n//! * You want a [`Vec`] or [`VecDeque`] of unknown size, and can't tolerate\n//!   amortization.\n//! * You want to efficiently split and append lists.\n//! * You are *absolutely* certain you *really*, *truly*, want a doubly linked\n//!   list.\n//!\n//! ### Use a `HashMap` when:\n//! * You want to associate arbitrary keys with an arbitrary value.\n//! * You want a cache.\n//! * You want a map, with no extra functionality.\n//!\n//! ### Use a `BTreeMap` when:\n//! * You want a map sorted by its keys.\n//! * You want to be able to get a range of entries on-demand.\n//! * You're interested in what the smallest or largest key-value pair is.\n//! * You want to find the largest or smallest key that is smaller or larger\n//!   than something.\n//!\n//! ### Use the `Set` variant of any of these `Map`s when:\n//! * You just want to remember which keys you've seen.\n//! * There is no meaningful value to associate with your keys.\n//! * You just want a set.\n//!\n//! ### Use a `BinaryHeap` when:\n//!\n//! * You want to store a bunch of elements, but only ever want to process the\n//!   \"biggest\" or \"most important\" one at any given time.\n//! * You want a priority queue.\n//!\n//! # Performance\n//!\n//! Choosing the right collection for the job requires an understanding of what\n//! each collection is good at. Here we briefly summarize the performance of\n//! different collections for certain important operations. For further details,\n//! see each type's documentation, and note that the names of actual methods may\n//! differ from the tables below on certain collections.\n//!\n//! Throughout the documentation, we will follow a few conventions. For all\n//! operations, the collection's size is denoted by n. If another collection is\n//! involved in the operation, it contains m elements. Operations which have an\n//! *amortized* cost are suffixed with a `*`. Operations with an *expected*\n//! cost are suffixed with a `~`.\n//!\n//! All amortized costs are for the potential need to resize when capacity is\n//! exhausted. If a resize occurs it will take *O*(*n*) time. Our collections never\n//! automatically shrink, so removal operations aren't amortized. Over a\n//! sufficiently large series of operations, the average cost per operation will\n//! deterministically equal the given cost.\n//!\n//! Only [`HashMap`] has expected costs, due to the probabilistic nature of hashing.\n//! It is theoretically possible, though very unlikely, for [`HashMap`] to\n//! experience worse performance.\n//!\n//! ## Sequences\n//!\n//! |                | get(i)                 | insert(i)               | remove(i)              | append    | split_off(i)           |\n//! |----------------|------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|-----------|------------------------|\n//! | [`Vec`]        | *O*(1)                 | *O*(*n*-*i*)*           | *O*(*n*-*i*)           | *O*(*m*)* | *O*(*n*-*i*)           |\n//! | [`VecDeque`]   | *O*(1)                 | *O*(min(*i*, *n*-*i*))* | *O*(min(*i*, *n*-*i*)) | *O*(*m*)* | *O*(min(*i*, *n*-*i*)) |\n//! | [`LinkedList`] | *O*(min(*i*, *n*-*i*)) | *O*(min(*i*, *n*-*i*))  | *O*(min(*i*, *n*-*i*)) | *O*(1)    | *O*(min(*i*, *n*-*i*)) |\n//!\n//! Note that where ties occur, [`Vec`] is generally going to be faster than [`VecDeque`], and\n//! [`VecDeque`] is generally going to be faster than [`LinkedList`].\n//!\n//! ## Maps\n//!\n//! For Sets, all operations have the cost of the equivalent Map operation.\n//!\n//! |              | get           | insert        | remove        | range         | append       |\n//! |--------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|\n//! | [`HashMap`]  | *O*(1)~       | *O*(1)~*      | *O*(1)~       | N/A           | N/A          |\n//! | [`BTreeMap`] | *O*(log(*n*)) | *O*(log(*n*)) | *O*(log(*n*)) | *O*(log(*n*)) | *O*(*n*+*m*) |\n//!\n//! # Correct and Efficient Usage of Collections\n//!\n//! Of course, knowing which collection is the right one for the job doesn't\n//! instantly permit you to use it correctly. Here are some quick tips for\n//! efficient and correct usage of the standard collections in general. If\n//! you're interested in how to use a specific collection in particular, consult\n//! its documentation for detailed discussion and code examples.\n//!\n//! ## Capacity Management\n//!\n//! Many collections provide several constructors and methods that refer to\n//! \"capacity\". These collections are generally built on top of an array.\n//! Optimally, this array would be exactly the right size to fit only the\n//! elements stored in the collection, but for the collection to do this would\n//! be very inefficient. If the backing array was exactly the right size at all\n//! times, then every time an element is inserted, the collection would have to\n//! grow the array to fit it. Due to the way memory is allocated and managed on\n//! most computers, this would almost surely require allocating an entirely new\n//! array and copying every single element from the old one into the new one.\n//! Hopefully you can see that this wouldn't be very efficient to do on every\n//! operation.\n//!\n//! Most collections therefore use an *amortized* allocation strategy. They\n//! generally let themselves have a fair amount of unoccupied space so that they\n//! only have to grow on occasion. When they do grow, they allocate a\n//! substantially larger array to move the elements into so that it will take a\n//! while for another grow to be required. While this strategy is great in\n//! general, it would be even better if the collection *never* had to resize its\n//! backing array. Unfortunately, the collection itself doesn't have enough\n//! information to do this itself. Therefore, it is up to us programmers to give\n//! it hints.\n//!\n//! Any `with_capacity` constructor will instruct the collection to allocate\n//! enough space for the specified number of elements. Ideally this will be for\n//! exactly that many elements, but some implementation details may prevent\n//! this. See collection-specific documentation for details. In general, use\n//! `with_capacity` when you know exactly how many elements will be inserted, or\n//! at least have a reasonable upper-bound on that number.\n//!\n//! When anticipating a large influx of elements, the `reserve` family of\n//! methods can be used to hint to the collection how much room it should make\n//! for the coming items. As with `with_capacity`, the precise behavior of\n//! these methods will be specific to the collection of interest.\n//!\n//! For optimal performance, collections will generally avoid shrinking\n//! themselves. If you believe that a collection will not soon contain any more\n//! elements, or just really need the memory, the `shrink_to_fit` method prompts\n//! the collection to shrink the backing array to the minimum size capable of\n//! holding its elements.\n//!\n//! Finally, if ever you're interested in what the actual capacity of the\n//! collection is, most collections provide a `capacity` method to query this\n//! information on demand. This can be useful for debugging purposes, or for\n//! use with the `reserve` methods.\n//!\n//! ## Iterators\n//!\n//! [Iterators][crate::iter]\n//! are a powerful and robust mechanism used throughout Rust's\n//! standard libraries. Iterators provide a sequence of values in a generic,\n//! safe, efficient and convenient way. The contents of an iterator are usually\n//! *lazily* evaluated, so that only the values that are actually needed are\n//! ever actually produced, and no allocation need be done to temporarily store\n//! them. Iterators are primarily consumed using a `for` loop, although many\n//! functions also take iterators where a collection or sequence of values is\n//! desired.\n//!\n//! All of the standard collections provide several iterators for performing\n//! bulk manipulation of their contents. The three primary iterators almost\n//! every collection should provide are `iter`, `iter_mut`, and `into_iter`.\n//! Some of these are not provided on collections where it would be unsound or\n//! unreasonable to provide them.\n//!\n//! `iter` provides an iterator of immutable references to all the contents of a\n//! collection in the most \"natural\" order. For sequence collections like [`Vec`],\n//! this means the items will be yielded in increasing order of index starting\n//! at 0. For ordered collections like [`BTreeMap`], this means that the items\n//! will be yielded in sorted order. For unordered collections like [`HashMap`],\n//! the items will be yielded in whatever order the internal representation made\n//! most convenient. This is great for reading through all the contents of the\n//! collection.\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];\n//! for x in vec.iter() {\n//!    println!(\"vec contained {x:?}\");\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! `iter_mut` provides an iterator of *mutable* references in the same order as\n//! `iter`. This is great for mutating all the contents of the collection.\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let mut vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];\n//! for x in vec.iter_mut() {\n//!    *x += 1;\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! `into_iter` transforms the actual collection into an iterator over its\n//! contents by-value. This is great when the collection itself is no longer\n//! needed, and the values are needed elsewhere. Using `extend` with `into_iter`\n//! is the main way that contents of one collection are moved into another.\n//! `extend` automatically calls `into_iter`, and takes any <code>T: [IntoIterator]</code>.\n//! Calling `collect` on an iterator itself is also a great way to convert one\n//! collection into another. Both of these methods should internally use the\n//! capacity management tools discussed in the previous section to do this as\n//! efficiently as possible.\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let mut vec1 = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];\n//! let vec2 = vec![10, 20, 30, 40];\n//! vec1.extend(vec2);\n//! ```\n//!\n//! ```\n//! use std::collections::VecDeque;\n//!\n//! let vec = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n//! let buf: VecDeque<_> = vec.into_iter().collect();\n//! ```\n//!\n//! Iterators also provide a series of *adapter* methods for performing common\n//! threads to sequences. Among the adapters are functional favorites like `map`,\n//! `fold`, `skip` and `take`. Of particular interest to collections is the\n//! `rev` adapter, which reverses any iterator that supports this operation. Most\n//! collections provide reversible iterators as the way to iterate over them in\n//! reverse order.\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];\n//! for x in vec.iter().rev() {\n//!    println!(\"vec contained {x:?}\");\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! Several other collection methods also return iterators to yield a sequence\n//! of results but avoid allocating an entire collection to store the result in.\n//! This provides maximum flexibility as\n//! [`collect`][crate::iter::Iterator::collect] or\n//! [`extend`][crate::iter::Extend::extend] can be called to\n//! \"pipe\" the sequence into any collection if desired. Otherwise, the sequence\n//! can be looped over with a `for` loop. The iterator can also be discarded\n//! after partial use, preventing the computation of the unused items.\n//!\n//! ## Entries\n//!\n//! The `entry` API is intended to provide an efficient mechanism for\n//! manipulating the contents of a map conditionally on the presence of a key or\n//! not. The primary motivating use case for this is to provide efficient\n//! accumulator maps. For instance, if one wishes to maintain a count of the\n//! number of times each key has been seen, they will have to perform some\n//! conditional logic on whether this is the first time the key has been seen or\n//! not. Normally, this would require a `find` followed by an `insert`,\n//! effectively duplicating the search effort on each insertion.\n//!\n//! When a user calls `map.entry(key)`, the map will search for the key and\n//! then yield a variant of the `Entry` enum.\n//!\n//! If a `Vacant(entry)` is yielded, then the key *was not* found. In this case\n//! the only valid operation is to `insert` a value into the entry. When this is\n//! done, the vacant entry is consumed and converted into a mutable reference to\n//! the value that was inserted. This allows for further manipulation of the\n//! value beyond the lifetime of the search itself. This is useful if complex\n//! logic needs to be performed on the value regardless of whether the value was\n//! just inserted.\n//!\n//! If an `Occupied(entry)` is yielded, then the key *was* found. In this case,\n//! the user has several options: they can `get`, `insert` or `remove` the\n//! value of the occupied entry. Additionally, they can convert the occupied\n//! entry into a mutable reference to its value, providing symmetry to the\n//! vacant `insert` case.\n//!\n//! ### Examples\n//!\n//! Here are the two primary ways in which `entry` is used. First, a simple\n//! example where the logic performed on the values is trivial.\n//!\n//! #### Counting the number of times each character in a string occurs\n//!\n//! ```\n//! use std::collections::btree_map::BTreeMap;\n//!\n//! let mut count = BTreeMap::new();\n//! let message = \"she sells sea shells by the sea shore\";\n//!\n//! for c in message.chars() {\n//!     *count.entry(c).or_insert(0) += 1;\n//! }\n//!\n//! assert_eq!(count.get(&'s'), Some(&8));\n//!\n//! println!(\"Number of occurrences of each character\");\n//! for (char, count) in &count {\n//!     println!(\"{char}: {count}\");\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! When the logic to be performed on the value is more complex, we may simply\n//! use the `entry` API to ensure that the value is initialized and perform the\n//! logic afterwards.\n//!\n//! #### Tracking the inebriation of customers at a bar\n//!\n//! ```\n//! use std::collections::btree_map::BTreeMap;\n//!\n//! // A client of the bar. They have a blood alcohol level.\n//! struct Person { blood_alcohol: f32 }\n//!\n//! // All the orders made to the bar, by client ID.\n//! let orders = vec![1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1];\n//!\n//! // Our clients.\n//! let mut blood_alcohol = BTreeMap::new();\n//!\n//! for id in orders {\n//!     // If this is the first time we've seen this customer, initialize them\n//!     // with no blood alcohol. Otherwise, just retrieve them.\n//!     let person = blood_alcohol.entry(id).or_insert(Person { blood_alcohol: 0.0 });\n//!\n//!     // Reduce their blood alcohol level. It takes time to order and drink a beer!\n//!     person.blood_alcohol *= 0.9;\n//!\n//!     // Check if they're sober enough to have another beer.\n//!     if person.blood_alcohol > 0.3 {\n//!         // Too drunk... for now.\n//!         println!(\"Sorry {id}, I have to cut you off\");\n//!     } else {\n//!         // Have another!\n//!         person.blood_alcohol += 0.1;\n//!     }\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! # Insert and complex keys\n//!\n//! If we have a more complex key, calls to `insert` will\n//! not update the value of the key. For example:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! use std::cmp::Ordering;\n//! use std::collections::BTreeMap;\n//! use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher};\n//!\n//! #[derive(Debug)]\n//! struct Foo {\n//!     a: u32,\n//!     b: &'static str,\n//! }\n//!\n//! // we will compare `Foo`s by their `a` value only.\n//! impl PartialEq for Foo {\n//!     fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool { self.a == other.a }\n//! }\n//!\n//! impl Eq for Foo {}\n//!\n//! // we will hash `Foo`s by their `a` value only.\n//! impl Hash for Foo {\n//!     fn hash<H: Hasher>(&self, h: &mut H) { self.a.hash(h); }\n//! }\n//!\n//! impl PartialOrd for Foo {\n//!     fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<Ordering> { self.a.partial_cmp(&other.a) }\n//! }\n//!\n//! impl Ord for Foo {\n//!     fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering { self.a.cmp(&other.a) }\n//! }\n//!\n//! let mut map = BTreeMap::new();\n//! map.insert(Foo { a: 1, b: \"baz\" }, 99);\n//!\n//! // We already have a Foo with an a of 1, so this will be updating the value.\n//! map.insert(Foo { a: 1, b: \"xyz\" }, 100);\n//!\n//! // The value has been updated...\n//! assert_eq!(map.values().next().unwrap(), &100);\n//!\n//! // ...but the key hasn't changed. b is still \"baz\", not \"xyz\".\n//! assert_eq!(map.keys().next().unwrap().b, \"baz\");\n//! ```\n\n#![stable(feature = \"rust1\", since = \"1.0.0\")]\n\n#[stable(feature = \"rust1\", since = \"1.0.0\")]\n// FIXME(#82080) The deprecation here is only theoretical, and does not actually produce a warning.\n#[deprecated(note = \"moved to `std::ops::Bound`\", since = \"1.26.0\")]\n#[doc(hidden)]\npub use crate::ops::Bound;\n\n#[stable(feature = \"rust1\", since = \"1.0.0\")]\npub use alloc_crate::collections::{binary_heap, btree_map, btree_set};\n#[stable(feature = \"rust1\", since = \"1.0.0\")]\npub use alloc_crate::collections::{linked_list, vec_deque};\n#[stable(feature = \"rust1\", since = \"1.0.0\")]\npub use alloc_crate::collections::{BTreeMap, BTreeSet, BinaryHeap};\n#[stable(feature = \"rust1\", since = \"1.0.0\")]\npub use alloc_crate::collections::{LinkedList, VecDeque};\n\n#[stable(feature = \"rust1\", since = \"1.0.0\")]\n#[doc(inline)]\npub use self::hash_map::HashMap;\n#[stable(feature = \"rust1\", since = \"1.0.0\")]\n#[doc(inline)]\npub use self::hash_set::HashSet;\n\n#[stable(feature = \"try_reserve\", since = \"1.57.0\")]\npub use alloc_crate::collections::TryReserveError;\n#[unstable(\n    feature = \"try_reserve_kind\",\n    reason = \"Uncertain how much info should be exposed\",\n    issue = \"48043\"\n)]\npub use alloc_crate::collections::TryReserveErrorKind;\n\nmod hash;\n\n#[stable(feature = \"rust1\", since = \"1.0.0\")]\npub mod hash_map {\n    //!

Collection types.\n//!\n//! Rust's standard collection library provides efficient implementations of the\n//! most common general purpose programming data structures. By using the\n//! standard implementations, it should be possible for two libraries to\n//! communicate without significant data conversion.\n//!\n//! To get this out of the way: you should probably just use [`Vec`] or [`HashMap`].\n//! These two collections cover most use cases for generic data storage and\n//! processing. They are exceptionally good at doing what they do. All the other\n//! collections in the standard library have specific use cases where they are\n//! the optimal choice, but these cases are borderline *niche* in comparison.\n//! Even when `Vec` and `HashMap` are technically suboptimal, they're probably a\n//! good enough choice to get started.\n//!\n//! Rust's collections can be grouped into four major categories:\n//!\n//! * Sequences: [`Vec`], [`VecDeque`], [`LinkedList`]\n//! * Maps: [`HashMap`], [`BTreeMap`]\n//! * Sets: [`HashSet`], [`BTreeSet`]\n//! * Misc: [`BinaryHeap`]\n//!\n//! # When Should You Use Which Collection?\n//!\n//! These are fairly high-level and quick break-downs of when each collection\n//! should be considered. Detailed discussions of strengths and weaknesses of\n//! individual collections can be found on their own documentation pages.\n//!\n//! ### Use a `Vec` when:\n//! * You want to collect items up to be processed or sent elsewhere later, and\n//!   don't care about any properties of the actual values being stored.\n//! * You want a sequence of elements in a particular order, and will only be\n//!   appending to (or near) the end.\n//! * You want a stack.\n//! * You want a resizable array.\n//! * You want a heap-allocated array.\n//!\n//! ### Use a `VecDeque` when:\n//! * You want a [`Vec`] that supports efficient insertion at both ends of the\n//!   sequence.\n//! * You want a queue.\n//! * You want a double-ended queue (deque).\n//!\n//! ### Use a `LinkedList` when:\n//! * You want a [`Vec`] or [`VecDeque`] of unknown size, and can't tolerate\n//!   amortization.\n//! * You want to efficiently split and append lists.\n//! * You are *absolutely* certain you *really*, *truly*, want a doubly linked\n//!   list.\n//!\n//! ### Use a `HashMap` when:\n//! * You want to associate arbitrary keys with an arbitrary value.\n//! * You want a cache.\n//! * You want a map, with no extra functionality.\n//!\n//! ### Use a `BTreeMap` when:\n//! * You want a map sorted by its keys.\n//! * You want to be able to get a range of entries on-demand.\n//! * You're interested in what the smallest or largest key-value pair is.\n//! * You want to find the largest or smallest key that is smaller or larger\n//!   than something.\n//!\n//! ### Use the `Set` variant of any of these `Map`s when:\n//! * You just want to remember which keys you've seen.\n//! * There is no meaningful value to associate with your keys.\n//! * You just want a set.\n//!\n//! ### Use a `BinaryHeap` when:\n//!\n//! * You want to store a bunch of elements, but only ever want to process the\n//!   \"biggest\" or \"most important\" one at any given time.\n//! * You want a priority queue.\n//!\n//! # Performance\n//!\n//! Choosing the right collection for the job requires an understanding of what\n//! each collection is good at. Here we briefly summarize the performance of\n//! different collections for certain important operations. For further details,\n//! see each type's documentation, and note that the names of actual methods may\n//! differ from the tables below on certain collections.\n//!\n//! Throughout the documentation, we will follow a few conventions. For all\n//! operations, the collection's size is denoted by n. If another collection is\n//! involved in the operation, it contains m elements. Operations which have an\n//! *amortized* cost are suffixed with a `*`. Operations with an *expected*\n//! cost are suffixed with a `~`.\n//!\n//! All amortized costs are for the potential need to resize when capacity is\n//! exhausted. If a resize occurs it will take *O*(*n*) time. Our collections never\n//! automatically shrink, so removal operations aren't amortized. Over a\n//! sufficiently large series of operations, the average cost per operation will\n//! deterministically equal the given cost.\n//!\n//! Only [`HashMap`] has expected costs, due to the probabilistic nature of hashing.\n//! It is theoretically possible, though very unlikely, for [`HashMap`] to\n//! experience worse performance.\n//!\n//! ## Sequences\n//!\n//! |                | get(i)                 | insert(i)               | remove(i)              | append    | split_off(i)           |\n//! |----------------|------------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|-----------|------------------------|\n//! | [`Vec`]        | *O*(1)                 | *O*(*n*-*i*)*           | *O*(*n*-*i*)           | *O*(*m*)* | *O*(*n*-*i*)           |\n//! | [`VecDeque`]   | *O*(1)                 | *O*(min(*i*, *n*-*i*))* | *O*(min(*i*, *n*-*i*)) | *O*(*m*)* | *O*(min(*i*, *n*-*i*)) |\n//! | [`LinkedList`] | *O*(min(*i*, *n*-*i*)) | *O*(min(*i*, *n*-*i*))  | *O*(min(*i*, *n*-*i*)) | *O*(1)    | *O*(min(*i*, *n*-*i*)) |\n//!\n//! Note that where ties occur, [`Vec`] is generally going to be faster than [`VecDeque`], and\n//! [`VecDeque`] is generally going to be faster than [`LinkedList`].\n//!\n//! ## Maps\n//!\n//! For Sets, all operations have the cost of the equivalent Map operation.\n//!\n//! |              | get           | insert        | remove        | range         | append       |\n//! |--------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|\n//! | [`HashMap`]  | *O*(1)~       | *O*(1)~*      | *O*(1)~       | N/A           | N/A          |\n//! | [`BTreeMap`] | *O*(log(*n*)) | *O*(log(*n*)) | *O*(log(*n*)) | *O*(log(*n*)) | *O*(*n*+*m*) |\n//!\n//! # Correct and Efficient Usage of Collections\n//!\n//! Of course, knowing which collection is the right one for the job doesn't\n//! instantly permit you to use it correctly. Here are some quick tips for\n//! efficient and correct usage of the standard collections in general. If\n//! you're interested in how to use a specific collection in particular, consult\n//! its documentation for detailed discussion and code examples.\n//!\n//! ## Capacity Management\n//!\n//! Many collections provide several constructors and methods that refer to\n//! \"capacity\". These collections are generally built on top of an array.\n//! Optimally, this array would be exactly the right size to fit only the\n//! elements stored in the collection, but for the collection to do this would\n//! be very inefficient. If the backing array was exactly the right size at all\n//! times, then every time an element is inserted, the collection would have to\n//! grow the array to fit it. Due to the way memory is allocated and managed on\n//! most computers, this would almost surely require allocating an entirely new\n//! array and copying every single element from the old one into the new one.\n//! Hopefully you can see that this wouldn't be very efficient to do on every\n//! operation.\n//!\n//! Most collections therefore use an *amortized* allocation strategy. They\n//! generally let themselves have a fair amount of unoccupied space so that they\n//! only have to grow on occasion. When they do grow, they allocate a\n//! substantially larger array to move the elements into so that it will take a\n//! while for another grow to be required. While this strategy is great in\n//! general, it would be even better if the collection *never* had to resize its\n//! backing array. Unfortunately, the collection itself doesn't have enough\n//! information to do this itself. Therefore, it is up to us programmers to give\n//! it hints.\n//!\n//! Any `with_capacity` constructor will instruct the collection to allocate\n//! enough space for the specified number of elements. Ideally this will be for\n//! exactly that many elements, but some implementation details may prevent\n//! this. See collection-specific documentation for details. In general, use\n//! `with_capacity` when you know exactly how many elements will be inserted, or\n//! at least have a reasonable upper-bound on that number.\n//!\n//! When anticipating a large influx of elements, the `reserve` family of\n//! methods can be used to hint to the collection how much room it should make\n//! for the coming items. As with `with_capacity`, the precise behavior of\n//! these methods will be specific to the collection of interest.\n//!\n//! For optimal performance, collections will generally avoid shrinking\n//! themselves. If you believe that a collection will not soon contain any more\n//! elements, or just really need the memory, the `shrink_to_fit` method prompts\n//! the collection to shrink the backing array to the minimum size capable of\n//! holding its elements.\n//!\n//! Finally, if ever you're interested in what the actual capacity of the\n//! collection is, most collections provide a `capacity` method to query this\n//! information on demand. This can be useful for debugging purposes, or for\n//! use with the `reserve` methods.\n//!\n//! ## Iterators\n//!\n//! [Iterators][crate::iter]\n//! are a powerful and robust mechanism used throughout Rust's\n//! standard libraries. Iterators provide a sequence of values in a generic,\n//! safe, efficient and convenient way. The contents of an iterator are usually\n//! *lazily* evaluated, so that only the values that are actually needed are\n//! ever actually produced, and no allocation need be done to temporarily store\n//! them. Iterators are primarily consumed using a `for` loop, although many\n//! functions also take iterators where a collection or sequence of values is\n//! desired.\n//!\n//! All of the standard collections provide several iterators for performing\n//! bulk manipulation of their contents. The three primary iterators almost\n//! every collection should provide are `iter`, `iter_mut`, and `into_iter`.\n//! Some of these are not provided on collections where it would be unsound or\n//! unreasonable to provide them.\n//!\n//! `iter` provides an iterator of immutable references to all the contents of a\n//! collection in the most \"natural\" order. For sequence collections like [`Vec`],\n//! this means the items will be yielded in increasing order of index starting\n//! at 0. For ordered collections like [`BTreeMap`], this means that the items\n//! will be yielded in sorted order. For unordered collections like [`HashMap`],\n//! the items will be yielded in whatever order the internal representation made\n//! most convenient. This is great for reading through all the contents of the\n//! collection.\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];\n//! for x in vec.iter() {\n//!    println!(\"vec contained {x:?}\");\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! `iter_mut` provides an iterator of *mutable* references in the same order as\n//! `iter`. This is great for mutating all the contents of the collection.\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let mut vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];\n//! for x in vec.iter_mut() {\n//!    *x += 1;\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! `into_iter` transforms the actual collection into an iterator over its\n//! contents by-value. This is great when the collection itself is no longer\n//! needed, and the values are needed elsewhere. Using `extend` with `into_iter`\n//! is the main way that contents of one collection are moved into another.\n//! `extend` automatically calls `into_iter`, and takes any &lt;code&gt;T: [IntoIterator]&lt;/code&gt;.\n//! Calling `collect` on an iterator itself is also a great way to convert one\n//! collection into another. Both of these methods should internally use the\n//! capacity management tools discussed in the previous section to do this as\n//! efficiently as possible.\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let mut vec1 = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];\n//! let vec2 = vec![10, 20, 30, 40];\n//! vec1.extend(vec2);\n//! ```\n//!\n//! ```\n//! use std::collections::VecDeque;\n//!\n//! let vec = [1, 2, 3, 4];\n//! let buf: VecDeque&lt;_&gt; = vec.into_iter().collect();\n//! ```\n//!\n//! Iterators also provide a series of *adapter* methods for performing common\n//! threads to sequences. Among the adapters are functional favorites like `map`,\n//! `fold`, `skip` and `take`. Of particular interest to collections is the\n//! `rev` adapter, which reverses any iterator that supports this operation. Most\n//! collections provide reversible iterators as the way to iterate over them in\n//! reverse order.\n//!\n//! ```\n//! let vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];\n//! for x in vec.iter().rev() {\n//!    println!(\"vec contained {x:?}\");\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! Several other collection methods also return iterators to yield a sequence\n//! of results but avoid allocating an entire collection to store the result in.\n//! This provides maximum flexibility as\n//! [`collect`][crate::iter::Iterator::collect] or\n//! [`extend`][crate::iter::Extend::extend] can be called to\n//! \"pipe\" the sequence into any collection if desired. Otherwise, the sequence\n//! can be looped over with a `for` loop. The iterator can also be discarded\n//! after partial use, preventing the computation of the unused items.\n//!\n//! ## Entries\n//!\n//! The `entry` API is intended to provide an efficient mechanism for\n//! manipulating the contents of a map conditionally on the presence of a key or\n//! not. The primary motivating use case for this is to provide efficient\n//! accumulator maps. For instance, if one wishes to maintain a count of the\n//! number of times each key has been seen, they will have to perform some\n//! conditional logic on whether this is the first time the key has been seen or\n//! not. Normally, this would require a `find` followed by an `insert`,\n//! effectively duplicating the search effort on each insertion.\n//!\n//! When a user calls `map.entry(key)`, the map will search for the key and\n//! then yield a variant of the `Entry` enum.\n//!\n//! If a `Vacant(entry)` is yielded, then the key *was not* found. In this case\n//! the only valid operation is to `insert` a value into the entry. When this is\n//! done, the vacant entry is consumed and converted into a mutable reference to\n//! the value that was inserted. This allows for further manipulation of the\n//! value beyond the lifetime of the search itself. This is useful if complex\n//! logic needs to be performed on the value regardless of whether the value was\n//! just inserted.\n//!\n//! If an `Occupied(entry)` is yielded, then the key *was* found. In this case,\n//! the user has several options: they can `get`, `insert` or `remove` the\n//! value of the occupied entry. Additionally, they can convert the occupied\n//! entry into a mutable reference to its value, providing symmetry to the\n//! vacant `insert` case.\n//!\n//! ### Examples\n//!\n//! Here are the two primary ways in which `entry` is used. First, a simple\n//! example where the logic performed on the values is trivial.\n//!\n//! #### Counting the number of times each character in a string occurs\n//!\n//! ```\n//! use std::collections::btree_map::BTreeMap;\n//!\n//! let mut count = BTreeMap::new();\n//! let message = \"she sells sea shells by the sea shore\";\n//!\n//! for c in message.chars() {\n//!     *count.entry(c).or_insert(0) += 1;\n//! }\n//!\n//! assert_eq!(count.get(&amp;'s'), Some(&amp;8));\n//!\n//! println!(\"Number of occurrences of each character\");\n//! for (char, count) in &amp;count {\n//!     println!(\"{char}: {count}\");\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! When the logic to be performed on the value is more complex, we may simply\n//! use the `entry` API to ensure that the value is initialized and perform the\n//! logic afterwards.\n//!\n//! #### Tracking the inebriation of customers at a bar\n//!\n//! ```\n//! use std::collections::btree_map::BTreeMap;\n//!\n//! // A client of the bar. They have a blood alcohol level.\n//! struct Person { blood_alcohol: f32 }\n//!\n//! // All the orders made to the bar, by client ID.\n//! let orders = vec![1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 1, 1, 1];\n//!\n//! // Our clients.\n//! let mut blood_alcohol = BTreeMap::new();\n//!\n//! for id in orders {\n//!     // If this is the first time we've seen this customer, initialize them\n//!     // with no blood alcohol. Otherwise, just retrieve them.\n//!     let person = blood_alcohol.entry(id).or_insert(Person { blood_alcohol: 0.0 });\n//!\n//!     // Reduce their blood alcohol level. It takes time to order and drink a beer!\n//!     person.blood_alcohol *= 0.9;\n//!\n//!     // Check if they're sober enough to have another beer.\n//!     if person.blood_alcohol &gt; 0.3 {\n//!         // Too drunk... for now.\n//!         println!(\"Sorry {id}, I have to cut you off\");\n//!     } else {\n//!         // Have another!\n//!         person.blood_alcohol += 0.1;\n//!     }\n//! }\n//! ```\n//!\n//! # Insert and complex keys\n//!\n//! If we have a more complex key, calls to `insert` will\n//! not update the value of the key. For example:\n//!\n//! ```\n//! use std::cmp::Ordering;\n//! use std::collections::BTreeMap;\n//! use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher};\n//!\n//! #[derive(Debug)]\n//! struct Foo {\n//!     a: u32,\n//!     b: &amp;'static str,\n//! }\n//!\n//! // we will compare `Foo`s by their `a` value only.\n//! impl PartialEq for Foo {\n//!     fn eq(&amp;self, other: &amp;Self) -&gt; bool { self.a == other.a }\n//! }\n//!\n//! impl Eq for Foo {}\n//!\n//! // we will hash `Foo`s by their `a` value only.\n//! impl Hash for Foo {\n//!     fn hash&lt;H: Hasher&gt;(&amp;self, h: &amp;mut H) { self.a.hash(h); }\n//! }\n//!\n//! impl PartialOrd for Foo {\n//!     fn partial_cmp(&amp;self, other: &amp;Self) -&gt; Option&lt;Ordering&gt; { self.a.partial_cmp(&amp;other.a) }\n//! }\n//!\n//! impl Ord for Foo {\n//!     fn cmp(&amp;self, other: &amp;Self) -&gt; Ordering { self.a.cmp(&amp;other.a) }\n//! }\n//!\n//! let mut map = BTreeMap::new();\n//! map.insert(Foo { a: 1, b: \"baz\" }, 99);\n//!\n//! // We already have a Foo with an a of 1, so this will be updating the value.\n//! map.insert(Foo { a: 1, b: \"xyz\" }, 100);\n//!\n//! // The value has been updated...\n//! assert_eq!(map.values().next().unwrap(), &amp;100);\n//!\n//! // ...but the key hasn't changed. b is still \"baz\", not \"xyz\".\n//! assert_eq!(map.keys().next().unwrap().b, \"baz\");\n//! ```\n\n</span><span class=\"attr\">#![stable(feature = <span class=\"string\">\"rust1\"</span>, since = <span class=\"string\">\"1.0.0\"</span>)]\n\n#[stable(feature = <span class=\"string\">\"rust1\"</span>, since = <span class=\"string\">\"1.0.0\"</span>)]\n</span><span class=\"comment\">// FIXME(#82080) The deprecation here is only theoretical, and does not actually produce a warning.\n</span><span class=\"attr\">#[deprecated(note = <span class=\"string\">\"moved to `std::ops::Bound`\"</span>, since = <span class=\"string\">\"1.26.0\"</span>)]\n#[doc(hidden)]\n</span><span class=\"kw\">pub use </span><span class=\"kw\">crate</span>::ops::Bound;\n\n<span class=\"attr\">#[stable(feature = <span class=\"string\">\"rust1\"</span>, since = <span class=\"string\">\"1.0.0\"</span>)]\n</span><span class=\"kw\">pub use </span>alloc_crate::collections::{binary_heap, btree_map, btree_set};\n<span class=\"attr\">#[stable(feature = <span class=\"string\">\"rust1\"</span>, since = <span class=\"string\">\"1.0.0\"</span>)]\n</span><span class=\"kw\">pub use </span>alloc_crate::collections::{linked_list, vec_deque};\n<span class=\"attr\">#[stable(feature = <span class=\"string\">\"rust1\"</span>, since = <span class=\"string\">\"1.0.0\"</span>)]\n</span><span class=\"kw\">pub use </span>alloc_crate::collections::{BTreeMap, BTreeSet, BinaryHeap};\n<span class=\"attr\">#[stable(feature = <span class=\"string\">\"rust1\"</span>, since = <span class=\"string\">\"1.0.0\"</span>)]\n</span><span class=\"kw\">pub use </span>alloc_crate::collections::{LinkedList, VecDeque};\n\n<span class=\"attr\">#[stable(feature = <span class=\"string\">\"rust1\"</span>, since = <span class=\"string\">\"1.0.0\"</span>)]\n#[doc(inline)]\n</span><span class=\"kw\">pub use </span><span class=\"self\">self</span>::hash_map::HashMap;\n<span class=\"attr\">#[stable(feature = <span class=\"string\">\"rust1\"</span>, since = <span class=\"string\">\"1.0.0\"</span>)]\n#[doc(inline)]\n</span><span class=\"kw\">pub use </span><span class=\"self\">self</span>::hash_set::HashSet;\n\n<span class=\"attr\">#[stable(feature = <span class=\"string\">\"try_reserve\"</span>, since = <span class=\"string\">\"1.57.0\"</span>)]\n</span><span class=\"kw\">pub use </span>alloc_crate::collections::TryReserveError;\n<span class=\"attr\">#[unstable(\n    feature = <span class=\"string\">\"try_reserve_kind\"</span>,\n    reason = <span class=\"string\">\"Uncertain how much info should be exposed\"</span>,\n    issue = <span class=\"string\">\"48043\"\n</span>)]\n</span><span class=\"kw\">pub use </span>alloc_crate::collections::TryReserveErrorKind;\n\n<span class=\"kw\">mod </span>hash;\n\n<span class=\"attr\">#[stable(feature = <span class=\"string\">\"rust1\"</span>, since = <span class=\"string\">\"1.0.0\"</span>)]\n</span><span class=\"kw\">pub mod </span>hash_map {\n    <span class=\"doccomment\">//!
