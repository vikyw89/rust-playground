It is instantiated with the [`thread_local!`] macro and the\n/// primary method is the [`with`] method, though there are helpers to make\n/// working with [`Cell`] types easier.\n///\n/// The [`with`] method yields a reference to the contained value which cannot\n/// outlive the current thread or escape the given closure.\n///\n/// [`thread_local!`]: crate::thread_local\n///\n/// # Initialization and Destruction\n///\n/// Initialization is dynamically performed on the first call to a setter (e.g.\n/// [`with`]) within a thread, and values that implement [`Drop`] get\n/// destructed when a thread exits. Some caveats apply, which are explained below.\n///\n/// A `LocalKey`'s initializer cannot recursively depend on itself. Using a\n/// `LocalKey` in this way may cause panics, aborts or infinite recursion on\n/// the first call to `with`.\n///\n/// # Single-thread Synchronization\n///\n/// Though there is no potential race with other threads, it is still possible to\n/// obtain multiple references to the thread-local data in different places on\n/// the call stack. For this reason, only shared (`&T`) references may be obtained.\n///\n/// To allow obtaining an exclusive mutable reference (`&mut T`), typically a\n/// [`Cell`] or [`RefCell`] is used (see the [`std::cell`] for more information\n/// on how exactly this works). To make this easier there are specialized\n/// implementations for [`LocalKey<Cell<T>>`] and [`LocalKey<RefCell<T>>`].\n///\n/// [`std::cell`]: `crate::cell`\n/// [`LocalKey<Cell<T>>`]: struct.LocalKey.html#impl-LocalKey<Cell<T>>\n/// [`LocalKey<RefCell<T>>`]: struct.LocalKey.html#impl-LocalKey<RefCell<T>>\n///\n///\n/// # Examples\n///\n/// ```\n/// use std::cell::Cell;\n/// use std::thread;\n///\n/// thread_local!(static FOO: Cell<u32> = Cell::new(1));\n///\n/// assert_eq!(FOO.get(), 1);\n/// FOO.set(2);\n///\n/// // each thread starts out with the initial value of 1\n/// let t = thread::spawn(move|| {\n///     assert_eq!(FOO.get(), 1);\n///     FOO.set(3);\n/// });\n///\n/// // wait for the thread to complete and bail out on panic\n/// t.join().unwrap();\n///\n/// // we retain our original value of 2 despite the child thread\n/// assert_eq!(FOO.get(), 2);\n/// ```\n///\n/// # Platform-specific behavior\n///\n/// Note that a \"best effort\" is made to ensure that destructors for types\n/// stored in thread local storage are run, but not all platforms can guarantee\n/// that destructors will be run for all types in thread local storage. For\n/// example, there are a number of known caveats where destructors are not run:\n///\n/// 1. On Unix systems when pthread-based TLS is being used, destructors will\n///    not be run for TLS values on the main thread when it exits. Note that the\n///    application will exit immediately after the main thread exits as well.\n/// 2. On all platforms it's possible for TLS to re-initialize other TLS slots\n///    during destruction. Some platforms ensure that this cannot happen\n///    infinitely by preventing re-initialization of any slot that has been\n///    destroyed, but not all platforms have this guard. Those platforms that do\n///    not guard typically have a synthetic limit after which point no more\n///    destructors are run.\n/// 3. When the process exits on Windows systems, TLS destructors may only be\n///    run on the thread that causes the process to exit. This is because the\n///    other threads may be forcibly terminated.\n///\n/// ## Synchronization in thread-local destructors\n///\n/// On Windows, synchronization operations (such as [`JoinHandle::join`]) in\n/// thread local destructors are prone to deadlocks and so should be avoided.\n/// This is because the [loader lock] is held while a destructor is run. The\n/// lock is acquired whenever a thread starts or exits or when a DLL is loaded\n/// or unloaded. Therefore these events are blocked for as long as a thread\n/// local destructor is running.\n///\n/// [loader lock]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-best-practices\n/// [`JoinHandle::join`]: crate::thread::JoinHandle::join\n/// [`with`]: LocalKey::with\n#[cfg_attr(not(test), rustc_diagnostic_item = \"LocalKey\")]\n#[stable(feature = \"rust1\", since = \"1.0.0\")]\npub struct LocalKey<T: 'static> {\n    // This outer `LocalKey<T>` type is what's going to be stored in statics,\n    // but actual data inside will sometimes be tagged with #[thread_local].\n    // It's not valid for a true static to reference a #[thread_local] static,\n    // so we get around that by exposing an accessor through a layer of function\n    // indirection (this thunk).\n    //\n    // Note that the thunk is itself unsafe because the returned lifetime of the\n    // slot where data lives, `'static`, is not actually valid.

It is instantiated with the [`thread_local!`] macro and the\n/// primary method is the [`with`] method, though there are helpers to make\n/// working with [`Cell`] types easier.\n///\n/// The [`with`] method yields a reference to the contained value which cannot\n/// outlive the current thread or escape the given closure.\n///\n/// [`thread_local!`]: crate::thread_local\n///\n/// # Initialization and Destruction\n///\n/// Initialization is dynamically performed on the first call to a setter (e.g.\n/// [`with`]) within a thread, and values that implement [`Drop`] get\n/// destructed when a thread exits. Some caveats apply, which are explained below.\n///\n/// A `LocalKey`'s initializer cannot recursively depend on itself. Using a\n/// `LocalKey` in this way may cause panics, aborts or infinite recursion on\n/// the first call to `with`.\n///\n/// # Single-thread Synchronization\n///\n/// Though there is no potential race with other threads, it is still possible to\n/// obtain multiple references to the thread-local data in different places on\n/// the call stack. For this reason, only shared (`&amp;T`) references may be obtained.\n///\n/// To allow obtaining an exclusive mutable reference (`&amp;mut T`), typically a\n/// [`Cell`] or [`RefCell`] is used (see the [`std::cell`] for more information\n/// on how exactly this works). To make this easier there are specialized\n/// implementations for [`LocalKey&lt;Cell&lt;T&gt;&gt;`] and [`LocalKey&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;`].\n///\n/// [`std::cell`]: `crate::cell`\n/// [`LocalKey&lt;Cell&lt;T&gt;&gt;`]: struct.LocalKey.html#impl-LocalKey&lt;Cell&lt;T&gt;&gt;\n/// [`LocalKey&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;`]: struct.LocalKey.html#impl-LocalKey&lt;RefCell&lt;T&gt;&gt;\n///\n///\n/// # Examples\n///\n/// ```\n/// use std::cell::Cell;\n/// use std::thread;\n///\n/// thread_local!(static FOO: Cell&lt;u32&gt; = Cell::new(1));\n///\n/// assert_eq!(FOO.get(), 1);\n/// FOO.set(2);\n///\n/// // each thread starts out with the initial value of 1\n/// let t = thread::spawn(move|| {\n///     assert_eq!(FOO.get(), 1);\n///     FOO.set(3);\n/// });\n///\n/// // wait for the thread to complete and bail out on panic\n/// t.join().unwrap();\n///\n/// // we retain our original value of 2 despite the child thread\n/// assert_eq!(FOO.get(), 2);\n/// ```\n///\n/// # Platform-specific behavior\n///\n/// Note that a \"best effort\" is made to ensure that destructors for types\n/// stored in thread local storage are run, but not all platforms can guarantee\n/// that destructors will be run for all types in thread local storage. For\n/// example, there are a number of known caveats where destructors are not run:\n///\n/// 1. On Unix systems when pthread-based TLS is being used, destructors will\n///    not be run for TLS values on the main thread when it exits. Note that the\n///    application will exit immediately after the main thread exits as well.\n/// 2. On all platforms it's possible for TLS to re-initialize other TLS slots\n///    during destruction. Some platforms ensure that this cannot happen\n///    infinitely by preventing re-initialization of any slot that has been\n///    destroyed, but not all platforms have this guard. Those platforms that do\n///    not guard typically have a synthetic limit after which point no more\n///    destructors are run.\n/// 3. When the process exits on Windows systems, TLS destructors may only be\n///    run on the thread that causes the process to exit. This is because the\n///    other threads may be forcibly terminated.\n///\n/// ## Synchronization in thread-local destructors\n///\n/// On Windows, synchronization operations (such as [`JoinHandle::join`]) in\n/// thread local destructors are prone to deadlocks and so should be avoided.\n/// This is because the [loader lock] is held while a destructor is run. The\n/// lock is acquired whenever a thread starts or exits or when a DLL is loaded\n/// or unloaded. Therefore these events are blocked for as long as a thread\n/// local destructor is running.\n///\n/// [loader lock]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/dynamic-link-library-best-practices\n/// [`JoinHandle::join`]: crate::thread::JoinHandle::join\n/// [`with`]: LocalKey::with\n</span><span class=\"attr\">#[cfg_attr(not(test), rustc_diagnostic_item = <span class=\"string\">\"LocalKey\"</span>)]\n#[stable(feature = <span class=\"string\">\"rust1\"</span>, since = <span class=\"string\">\"1.0.0\"</span>)]\n</span><span class=\"kw\">pub struct </span>LocalKey&lt;T: <span class=\"lifetime\">'static</span>&gt; {\n    <span class=\"comment\">// This outer `LocalKey&lt;T&gt;` type is what's going to be stored in statics,\n    // but actual data inside will sometimes be tagged with #[thread_local].\n    // It's not valid for a true static to reference a #[thread_local] static,\n    // so we get around that by exposing an accessor through a layer of function\n    // indirection (this thunk).\n    //\n    // Note that the thunk is itself unsafe because the returned lifetime of the\n    // slot where data lives, `'static`, is not actually valid.
