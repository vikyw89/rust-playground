The Rust Standard Library is the foundation of portable Rust software, a\n//! set of minimal and battle-tested shared abstractions for the [broader Rust\n//! ecosystem][crates.io]. It offers core types, like [`Vec<T>`] and\n//! [`Option<T>`], library-defined [operations on language\n//! primitives](#primitives), [standard macros](#macros), [I/O] and\n//! [multithreading], among [many other things][other].\n//!\n//! `std` is available to all Rust crates by default. Therefore, the\n//! standard library can be accessed in [`use`] statements through the path\n//! `std`, as in [`use std::env`].\n//!\n//! # How to read this documentation\n//!\n//! If you already know the name of what you are looking for, the fastest way to\n//! find it is to use the <a href=\"#\" onclick=\"window.searchState.focus();\">search\n//! bar</a> at the top of the page.\n//!\n//! Otherwise, you may want to jump to one of these useful sections:\n//!\n//! * [`std::*` modules](#modules)\n//! * [Primitive types](#primitives)\n//! * [Standard macros](#macros)\n//! * [The Rust Prelude]\n//!\n//! If this is your first time, the documentation for the standard library is\n//! written to be casually perused. Clicking on interesting things should\n//! generally lead you to interesting places. Still, there are important bits\n//! you don't want to miss, so read on for a tour of the standard library and\n//! its documentation!\n//!\n//! Once you are familiar with the contents of the standard library you may\n//! begin to find the verbosity of the prose distracting. At this stage in your\n//! development you may want to press the `[-]` button near the top of the\n//! page to collapse it into a more skimmable view.\n//!\n//! While you are looking at that `[-]` button also notice the `source`\n//! link. Rust's API documentation comes with the source code and you are\n//! encouraged to read it. The standard library source is generally high\n//! quality and a peek behind the curtains is often enlightening.\n//!\n//! # What is in the standard library documentation?\n//!\n//! First of all, The Rust Standard Library is divided into a number of focused\n//! modules, [all listed further down this page](#modules). These modules are\n//! the bedrock upon which all of Rust is forged, and they have mighty names\n//! like [`std::slice`] and [`std::cmp`]. Modules' documentation typically\n//! includes an overview of the module along with examples, and are a smart\n//! place to start familiarizing yourself with the library.\n//!\n//! Second, implicit methods on [primitive types] are documented here. This can\n//! be a source of confusion for two reasons:\n//!\n//! 1. While primitives are implemented by the compiler, the standard library\n//!    implements methods directly on the primitive types (and it is the only\n//!    library that does so), which are [documented in the section on\n//!    primitives](#primitives).\n//! 2. The standard library exports many modules *with the same name as\n//!    primitive types*. These define additional items related to the primitive\n//!    type, but not the all-important methods.\n//!\n//! So for example there is a [page for the primitive type\n//! `i32`](primitive::i32) that lists all the methods that can be called on\n//! 32-bit integers (very useful), and there is a [page for the module\n//! `std::i32`] that documents the constant values [`MIN`] and [`MAX`] (rarely\n//! useful).\n//!\n//! Note the documentation for the primitives [`str`] and [`[T]`][prim@slice] (also\n//! called 'slice'). Many method calls on [`String`] and [`Vec<T>`] are actually\n//! calls to methods on [`str`] and [`[T]`][prim@slice] respectively, via [deref\n//! coercions][deref-coercions].\n//!\n//! Third, the standard library defines [The Rust Prelude], a small collection\n//! of items - mostly traits - that are imported into every module of every\n//! crate. The traits in the prelude are pervasive, making the prelude\n//! documentation a good entry point to learning about the library.\n//!\n//! And finally, the standard library exports a number of standard macros, and\n//! [lists them on this page](#macros) (technically, not all of the standard\n//! macros are defined by the standard library - some are defined by the\n//! compiler - but they are documented here the same). Like the prelude, the\n//! standard macros are imported by default into all crates.\n//!\n//! # Contributing changes to the documentation\n//!\n//! Check out the Rust contribution guidelines [here](\n//! https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/contributing.html#writing-documentation).\n//! The source for this documentation can be found on\n//! [GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).\n//! To contribute changes, make sure you read the guidelines first, then submit\n//! pull-requests for your suggested changes.\n//!\n//! Contributions are appreciated! If you see a part of the docs that can be\n//! improved, submit a PR, or chat with us first on [Discord][rust-discord]\n//! #docs.\n//!\n//! # A Tour of The Rust Standard Library\n//!\n//! The rest of this crate documentation is dedicated to pointing out notable\n//! features of The Rust Standard Library.\n//!\n//! ## Containers and collections\n//!\n//! The [`option`] and [`result`] modules define optional and error-handling\n//! types, [`Option<T>`] and [`Result<T, E>`]. The [`iter`] module defines\n//! Rust's iterator trait, [`Iterator`], which works with the [`for`] loop to\n//! access collections.\n//!\n//! The standard library exposes three common ways to deal with contiguous\n//! regions of memory:\n//!\n//! * [`Vec<T>`] - A heap-allocated *vector* that is resizable at runtime.\n//! * [`[T; N]`][prim@array] - An inline *array* with a fixed size at compile time.\n//! * [`[T]`][prim@slice] - A dynamically sized *slice* into any other kind of contiguous\n//!   storage, whether heap-allocated or not.\n//!\n//! Slices can only be handled through some kind of *pointer*, and as such come\n//! in many flavors such as:\n//!\n//! * `&[T]` - *shared slice*\n//! * `&mut [T]` - *mutable slice*\n//! * [`Box<[T]>`][owned slice] - *owned slice*\n//!\n//! [`str`], a UTF-8 string slice, is a primitive type, and the standard library\n//! defines many methods for it. Rust [`str`]s are typically accessed as\n//! immutable references: `&str`. Use the owned [`String`] for building and\n//! mutating strings.\n//!\n//! For converting to strings use the [`format!`] macro, and for converting from\n//! strings use the [`FromStr`] trait.\n//!\n//! Data may be shared by placing it in a reference-counted box or the [`Rc`]\n//! type, and if further contained in a [`Cell`] or [`RefCell`], may be mutated\n//! as well as shared. Likewise, in a concurrent setting it is common to pair an\n//! atomically-reference-counted box, [`Arc`], with a [`Mutex`] to get the same\n//! effect.\n//!\n//! The [`collections`] module defines maps, sets, linked lists and other\n//! typical collection types, including the common [`HashMap<K, V>`].\n//!\n//! ## Platform abstractions and I/O\n//!\n//! Besides basic data types, the standard library is largely concerned with\n//! abstracting over differences in common platforms, most notably Windows and\n//! Unix derivatives.\n//!\n//! Common types of I/O, including [files], [TCP], and [UDP], are defined in\n//! the [`io`], [`fs`], and [`net`] modules.\n//!\n//! The [`thread`] module contains Rust's threading abstractions. [`sync`]\n//! contains further primitive shared memory types, including [`atomic`] and\n//! [`mpsc`], which contains the channel types for message passing.\n//!\n//! # Use before and after `main()`\n//!\n//! Many parts of the standard library are expected to work before and after `main()`;\n//! but this is not guaranteed or ensured by tests. It is recommended that you write your own tests\n//! and run them on each platform you wish to support.\n//! This means that use of `std` before/after main, especially of features that interact with the\n//! OS or global state, is exempted from stability and portability guarantees and instead only\n//! provided on a best-effort basis. Nevertheless bug reports are appreciated.\n//!\n//! On the other hand `core` and `alloc` are most likely to work in such environments with\n//! the caveat that any hookable behavior such as panics, oom handling or allocators will also\n//! depend on the compatibility of the hooks.\n//!\n//! Some features may also behave differently outside main, e.g. stdio could become unbuffered,\n//! some panics might turn into aborts, backtraces might not get symbolicated or similar.\n//!\n//! Non-exhaustive list of known limitations:\n//!\n//! - after-main use of thread-locals, which also affects additional features:\n//!   - [`thread::current()`]\n//!   - [`thread::scope()`]\n//!   - [`sync::mpsc`]\n//! - before-main stdio file descriptors are not guaranteed to be open on unix platforms\n//!\n//!\n//!

The Rust Standard Library is the foundation of portable Rust software, a\n//! set of minimal and battle-tested shared abstractions for the [broader Rust\n//! ecosystem][crates.io]. It offers core types, like [`Vec&lt;T&gt;`] and\n//! [`Option&lt;T&gt;`], library-defined [operations on language\n//! primitives](#primitives), [standard macros](#macros), [I/O] and\n//! [multithreading], among [many other things][other].\n//!\n//! `std` is available to all Rust crates by default. Therefore, the\n//! standard library can be accessed in [`use`] statements through the path\n//! `std`, as in [`use std::env`].\n//!\n//! # How to read this documentation\n//!\n//! If you already know the name of what you are looking for, the fastest way to\n//! find it is to use the &lt;a href=\"#\" onclick=\"window.searchState.focus();\"&gt;search\n//! bar&lt;/a&gt; at the top of the page.\n//!\n//! Otherwise, you may want to jump to one of these useful sections:\n//!\n//! * [`std::*` modules](#modules)\n//! * [Primitive types](#primitives)\n//! * [Standard macros](#macros)\n//! * [The Rust Prelude]\n//!\n//! If this is your first time, the documentation for the standard library is\n//! written to be casually perused. Clicking on interesting things should\n//! generally lead you to interesting places. Still, there are important bits\n//! you don't want to miss, so read on for a tour of the standard library and\n//! its documentation!\n//!\n//! Once you are familiar with the contents of the standard library you may\n//! begin to find the verbosity of the prose distracting. At this stage in your\n//! development you may want to press the `[-]` button near the top of the\n//! page to collapse it into a more skimmable view.\n//!\n//! While you are looking at that `[-]` button also notice the `source`\n//! link. Rust's API documentation comes with the source code and you are\n//! encouraged to read it. The standard library source is generally high\n//! quality and a peek behind the curtains is often enlightening.\n//!\n//! # What is in the standard library documentation?\n//!\n//! First of all, The Rust Standard Library is divided into a number of focused\n//! modules, [all listed further down this page](#modules). These modules are\n//! the bedrock upon which all of Rust is forged, and they have mighty names\n//! like [`std::slice`] and [`std::cmp`]. Modules' documentation typically\n//! includes an overview of the module along with examples, and are a smart\n//! place to start familiarizing yourself with the library.\n//!\n//! Second, implicit methods on [primitive types] are documented here. This can\n//! be a source of confusion for two reasons:\n//!\n//! 1. While primitives are implemented by the compiler, the standard library\n//!    implements methods directly on the primitive types (and it is the only\n//!    library that does so), which are [documented in the section on\n//!    primitives](#primitives).\n//! 2. The standard library exports many modules *with the same name as\n//!    primitive types*. These define additional items related to the primitive\n//!    type, but not the all-important methods.\n//!\n//! So for example there is a [page for the primitive type\n//! `i32`](primitive::i32) that lists all the methods that can be called on\n//! 32-bit integers (very useful), and there is a [page for the module\n//! `std::i32`] that documents the constant values [`MIN`] and [`MAX`] (rarely\n//! useful).\n//!\n//! Note the documentation for the primitives [`str`] and [`[T]`][prim@slice] (also\n//! called 'slice'). Many method calls on [`String`] and [`Vec&lt;T&gt;`] are actually\n//! calls to methods on [`str`] and [`[T]`][prim@slice] respectively, via [deref\n//! coercions][deref-coercions].\n//!\n//! Third, the standard library defines [The Rust Prelude], a small collection\n//! of items - mostly traits - that are imported into every module of every\n//! crate. The traits in the prelude are pervasive, making the prelude\n//! documentation a good entry point to learning about the library.\n//!\n//! And finally, the standard library exports a number of standard macros, and\n//! [lists them on this page](#macros) (technically, not all of the standard\n//! macros are defined by the standard library - some are defined by the\n//! compiler - but they are documented here the same). Like the prelude, the\n//! standard macros are imported by default into all crates.\n//!\n//! # Contributing changes to the documentation\n//!\n//! Check out the Rust contribution guidelines [here](\n//! https://rustc-dev-guide.rust-lang.org/contributing.html#writing-documentation).\n//! The source for this documentation can be found on\n//! [GitHub](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).\n//! To contribute changes, make sure you read the guidelines first, then submit\n//! pull-requests for your suggested changes.\n//!\n//! Contributions are appreciated! If you see a part of the docs that can be\n//! improved, submit a PR, or chat with us first on [Discord][rust-discord]\n//! #docs.\n//!\n//! # A Tour of The Rust Standard Library\n//!\n//! The rest of this crate documentation is dedicated to pointing out notable\n//! features of The Rust Standard Library.\n//!\n//! ## Containers and collections\n//!\n//! The [`option`] and [`result`] modules define optional and error-handling\n//! types, [`Option&lt;T&gt;`] and [`Result&lt;T, E&gt;`]. The [`iter`] module defines\n//! Rust's iterator trait, [`Iterator`], which works with the [`for`] loop to\n//! access collections.\n//!\n//! The standard library exposes three common ways to deal with contiguous\n//! regions of memory:\n//!\n//! * [`Vec&lt;T&gt;`] - A heap-allocated *vector* that is resizable at runtime.\n//! * [`[T; N]`][prim@array] - An inline *array* with a fixed size at compile time.\n//! * [`[T]`][prim@slice] - A dynamically sized *slice* into any other kind of contiguous\n//!   storage, whether heap-allocated or not.\n//!\n//! Slices can only be handled through some kind of *pointer*, and as such come\n//! in many flavors such as:\n//!\n//! * `&amp;[T]` - *shared slice*\n//! * `&amp;mut [T]` - *mutable slice*\n//! * [`Box&lt;[T]&gt;`][owned slice] - *owned slice*\n//!\n//! [`str`], a UTF-8 string slice, is a primitive type, and the standard library\n//! defines many methods for it. Rust [`str`]s are typically accessed as\n//! immutable references: `&amp;str`. Use the owned [`String`] for building and\n//! mutating strings.\n//!\n//! For converting to strings use the [`format!`] macro, and for converting from\n//! strings use the [`FromStr`] trait.\n//!\n//! Data may be shared by placing it in a reference-counted box or the [`Rc`]\n//! type, and if further contained in a [`Cell`] or [`RefCell`], may be mutated\n//! as well as shared. Likewise, in a concurrent setting it is common to pair an\n//! atomically-reference-counted box, [`Arc`], with a [`Mutex`] to get the same\n//! effect.\n//!\n//! The [`collections`] module defines maps, sets, linked lists and other\n//! typical collection types, including the common [`HashMap&lt;K, V&gt;`].\n//!\n//! ## Platform abstractions and I/O\n//!\n//! Besides basic data types, the standard library is largely concerned with\n//! abstracting over differences in common platforms, most notably Windows and\n//! Unix derivatives.\n//!\n//! Common types of I/O, including [files], [TCP], and [UDP], are defined in\n//! the [`io`], [`fs`], and [`net`] modules.\n//!\n//! The [`thread`] module contains Rust's threading abstractions. [`sync`]\n//! contains further primitive shared memory types, including [`atomic`] and\n//! [`mpsc`], which contains the channel types for message passing.\n//!\n//! # Use before and after `main()`\n//!\n//! Many parts of the standard library are expected to work before and after `main()`;\n//! but this is not guaranteed or ensured by tests. It is recommended that you write your own tests\n//! and run them on each platform you wish to support.\n//! This means that use of `std` before/after main, especially of features that interact with the\n//! OS or global state, is exempted from stability and portability guarantees and instead only\n//! provided on a best-effort basis. Nevertheless bug reports are appreciated.\n//!\n//! On the other hand `core` and `alloc` are most likely to work in such environments with\n//! the caveat that any hookable behavior such as panics, oom handling or allocators will also\n//! depend on the compatibility of the hooks.\n//!\n//! Some features may also behave differently outside main, e.g. stdio could become unbuffered,\n//! some panics might turn into aborts, backtraces might not get symbolicated or similar.\n//!\n//! Non-exhaustive list of known limitations:\n//!\n//! - after-main use of thread-locals, which also affects additional features:\n//!   - [`thread::current()`]\n//!   - [`thread::scope()`]\n//!   - [`sync::mpsc`]\n//! - before-main stdio file descriptors are not guaranteed to be open on unix platforms\n//!\n//!\n//!
